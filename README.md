# munkireport_in_azure

Hi! I created a script to deploy MunkiReport quickly.

Here it is: [`munkireport_in_azure.sh`](https://github.com/flammable/munkireport_in_azure/blob/main/munkireport_in_azure.sh)

I never got around to writing documentation for this script, but hopefully it still works. If you need help, visit the #munkireport channel in the MacAdmins Slack and I'll do my best to help.
